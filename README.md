# 🎯 Network Security Analytics Platform

**A comprehensive machine learning platform for real-time network intrusion detection and security analytics.**

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project demonstrates enterprise-grade network security analytics using machine learning techniques. Built as part of my data science journey targeting cybersecurity roles at companies like Cisco.

### 🎯 Business Objectives
- **Real-time threat detection**: Identify network intrusions as they happen
- **Behavioral analytics**: Detect insider threats and anomalous user behavior
- **Executive insights**: Provide C-level security posture dashboards
- **Operational efficiency**: Reduce false positives and response times

### 📊 Technical Highlights
- **Dataset**: KDD Cup 1999 Network Intrusion Detection (22,544 records, 41 features)
- **ML Techniques**: Classification, anomaly detection, time series analysis
- **Deployment**: AWS cloud infrastructure with real-time API
- **Dashboards**: Executive and SOC analyst interfaces

## 🏗️ Architecture

Raw Network Logs → ETL Pipeline → Feature Engineering → ML Models → Real-time API → Dashboards
